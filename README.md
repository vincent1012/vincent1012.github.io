    I created 4 pages, Homepage, Portfolio Page, About Page and Contact Page, and another 4 sub-pages under Portfolio Page, according to Assignment 1 of the UX Design course, doing some adjustments.
    
    For my Homepage, the most important page, I used Flexbox and Grid to structure the layout. For <header> section, I used Grid to set up the place of the logo and navigation bars and to make them responsive from mobile view to desktop view. For the banner-image in the header, I used the <picture> tag and <srcset> and <media> attributes, to provide an optimized image loading. For the <main> section, I used Grid to do the layout. It looked good from mobile view to tablet view. When it went to desktop, I wanted to create a spiral layout with four images surrounding a text in the center. At first, I used the <picture> tag, <srcset> and <media> attributes. But this layout of desktop view messed up.  Then instead of using <picture> tag, I changed to simply use background image inserting a URL. It still didn’t look right. Then I added “height: 100%” to the images on left and right, and set up a 300 px height to the images on top and bottom. It worked eventually.  To make the title stay on the certain place of each image in the spiral layout, I used the Position property. For the footer, in order to organize the social media buttons and the email & phone info, I used Flexbox to make them fit to the screen from mobile view to desktop view.
    
	For my Portfolio page, to organize four parts of my works, I used Grid to do the layout. I also used Grid to display multiple images or videos in the sub-page of each part in the Portfolio page. In my opinion, I can control the layout using Grid more specifically than using Flexbox. In the Web-design Works sub-page, I put two works, the final project of Responsive Web design course last semester and the Zen-garden this semester. At first, I added nothing additional to these two websites. After I checked the usability later, I found if I clicked into these two separate sites, it’s difficult to come back to the Portfolio page. Therefore, I added “Back to Portfolio Page” link on the top and bottom of each single page to the two sites, to improve user experience.
    
	For my About page, I still used Grid the arrange the image and text in each part. 
    
	For my Contact page, I used Flexbox to organize the Name and Email input areas.
    
	Through this assignment, I learned how to organize the images and texts efficiently by using Flexbox, Grid and Position property. I also realized the importance of making the style of all pages consistent and the using fluency from page to page.
    
	Among all images I used, the logo in every page, the banner photo and “My Story” photo in Homepage, the “Photography Works” photos in sub-page of Portfolio page, and the “Story of Me” photo in About page are my own pictures. The rest are stock images. The fonts of Acme, Crete Round and PT Sans Narrow I used are google fonts.
